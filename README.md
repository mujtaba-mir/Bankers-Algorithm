# Bankers Algorithm 
This project was developed as a part of a college assignment of Operating Systems (CSE-316)
It implements the Banker's algorithm, a classical resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm.
The code is written in the C programming language and serves as an educational and practical example of how the Banker's
algorithm can be applied to manage resources in a multi-process system.
